Quick Start
To make an API call, you must request an authentication token and call the API using an HTTP method and a URL, which includes a root unique to you and one of the URLs (or endpoints) listed in the Developer Hub.

Prerequisites
The following are required to invoke the API:

A client ID and client secret. Refer to the Client ID and client secret topic for more information.
If you have not already done so, be sure to understand the basic structure of our API outlined in the Foundations topic.
Call the API
Before you make an API call, it is helpful to understand the flow typical of every interaction between an application and the API. After the flow is described, we move on to exercises and code examples.

Anatomy of an API call
Every API call follows this basic flow:

Your application requests and receives an OAuth 2.0 token from the authentication server.
Your application invokes the API by making a properly-formatted call consisting of an verb (HTTP method) and a noun (API resource in the form of a URL) along with all necessary HTTP headers, parameters, and any required JSON body.
Your authorization token is validated.
If valid, the system receives and processes your application's API request.
The system returns an API response to your application.
Exercises
The following exercises illustrate simple calls against the API. If you have access to the API, feel free to follow along and try out a call yourself.

Generate a token
Note: This exercise uses the Postman extension for Google Chrome.

Note: If you are using a token provided by a federated identity management system, include the federated token as your access_token value just as you would use a normally-generated access_token.

To obtain an access token:

Open Postman

Create and Save a Request

Change the METHOD to POST

Add the authentication URL: https://HOSTNAME/api/authentication/access_token

Note: Remember to replace HOSTNAME with the unique portion of your tenant's URL.

Select Headers and add the following key/value pairs:

Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Select Body

Choose content type x-www-form-urlencoded

Add the following key/value pairs:

username : USERNAME
password : PASSWORD
client_id : CLIENT ID
client_secret : CLIENT PASSWORD
grant_type : password
auth_chain : OAuthLdapService
Select Send to generate and receive an access token

Note: You should select and copy your access token before you leave this screen.

Refer to the Authentication and security topic for more information about generating and refreshing an access token.

Call an API resource
Once you have an access token, you're ready to call an API resource. The following exercises step you through a set of sample calls.

First exercise
Note: This exercise uses the Postman extension for Google Chrome.

Note: If you are using a token provided by a federated identity management system, include the federated token as your access_token value just as you would use a normally-generated access_token.

This exercise calls the Retrieve Person by ID operation using the GET HTTP method.

To call the API:

Open Postman

Ensure the METHOD is GET

Add the URL: https://HOSTNAME/api/v1/commons/persons/PERSONID

Note: The URL is composed of two parts: a root (https://HOSTNAME/api) and an endpoint (/v1/commons/persons/PERSONID). The Developer Hub documents all available endpoints.

Note: Remember to replace HOSTNAME with the unique portion of your tenant's URL and PERSONID with a valid person number.

Select Headers and add the following key/value pairs:

content-type : application/json

Authorization : ACCESS_TOKEN

Note: Replace ACCESS_TOKEN with the token generated during the Generate a token exercise.

Select Send to call the API
This call returns a response body similar to the following example:

JSON

{
    "personIdentity": {
        "personKey": 210
    },
    "personInformation": {
        "accessAssignment": {},
        "employmentStatusList": [
            {
                "effectiveDate": "2016-08-13",
                "employmentStatusName": "Active",
                "expirationDate": "3000-01-01"
            }
        ],
        "expectedHoursList": [
            {
                "quantity": 8,
                "timePeriodTypeName": "Daily"
            },
            {
                "quantity": 40,
                "timePeriodTypeName": "Weekly"
            },
            {
                "quantity": 80,
                "timePeriodTypeName": "Pay Period"
            }
        ],
...
}
Second exercise
Note: This exercise uses the Postman extension for Google Chrome.

Note: If you are using a token provided by a federated identity management system, include the federated token as your access_token value just as you would use a normally-generated access_token.

This exercise calls the Retrieve Aggregated Data operation using the POST HTTP method and a JSON request body.

To call the API:

Open Postman

Ensure the METHOD is POST

Add the URL: https://HOSTNAME/api/v1/commons/data/multi_read

Note: The URL is composed of two parts: a root (https://HOSTNAME/api) and an endpoint (/v1/commons/data/multi_read). The Developer Hub documents all available endpoints.

Note: Remember to replace HOSTNAME with the unique portion of your tenant's URL.

Select Headers and add the following key/value pairs:

content-type : application/json

Authorization : ACCESS_TOKEN

Note: Replace ACCESS_TOKEN with the token generated during the Generate a token exercise.

Select Body

Choose body type raw

Add the call body

JSON

{
  "select": [
    {"key": "EMP_COMMON_FULL_NAME"},
    {"key": "EMP_COMMON_PRIMARY_JOB"},
    {"key": "EMP_COMMON_PRIMARY_ORG"},
    {"key": "PEOPLE_HIRE_DATE"}],
  "from": {
    "view": "EMP",
    "employeeSet": {
      "hyperfind": {
        "id": "1"
      },
      "dateRange": {
        "symbolicPeriod": {
          "id": 5
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "where": [
    {
      "key": "EMP_COMMON_PRIMARY_JOB",
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "values": [
        "Apprentice"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
